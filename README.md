# Optimization_Algorithm_for_the_Flowshop_Problem
The FLOW-SHOP problem, an NP-HARD scheduling issue, challenges even the best algorithms for small-scale instances. This paper proposes three solutions: (1) Hill-climbing (2) Combining hill-climbing with simulated annealing as a metaheuristic (3) Utilizing genetic algorithms while attempting to optimize them by incorporating hill-climbing.
